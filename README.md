# Portfolio Application ðŸ‘½

The project is built according to the SPA principle, which is implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. This project is written using HTML, CSS, Vanilla Js, Express, Joi, MySQl and deployed using Fly.io.

## Client Part

The client part is implemented using representations. The project used the Abstract Class principle. The representations of the various "pages" were modeled after the main class. The main manipulation of representations and data takes place in the `index.js` file.

## Server Part

The server part is implemented using Express. Authorization is implemented using Express Session. The main data manipulation takes place in the file `server.js`. Controllers, services, paths are located in the corresponding folders of the domain.
